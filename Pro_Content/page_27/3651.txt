Slitherlink puzzles are gaining momentum, and books of Slitherlink puzzles have started showing up around the world. The puzzles are simple to understand, but can be challenging to solve. The puzzle is simply a rectangular grid of dots that forms a collection of cells, every cell being either blank or containing an integer from zero to three. The challenge is to connect the dots with line segments to form a cycle (a connected path such that every vertex has precisely two incident edges), in such a way that every cell with a value has exactly the number of incident edges as the digit it contains. Cells with no value may have any number of incident edges. A valid Slitherlink puzzle always contains sufficient non-empty cells to guarantee a unique solution. Below is an example from the Nikoli web site of a Slitherlink puzzle and its solution.</p><p><img alt="slitherlink example" src="images/3651_1.png"></p><p>It was shown by Takayuki Yato at the University of Tokyo that the general Slitherlink problem is NP-complete. (If you are not familiar with this concept, informally it means there is no "efficient" algorithm to solve the problem.) With a slight modification and some simple heuristics, however, programmatic solutions are possible. Our new puzzle, which we will term Slink, differs from Slitherlink only in that the puzzle may not have empty cells. That is, every cell must specify the number of incident edges. Below is the Slitherlink puzzle above converted to Slink (the added numbers are shown in gray). Note that the solution does not change, only the information given in the puzzle itself.</p><p><img alt="slink example" src="images/3651_2.png"></p><p>The heuristics for solving Slink arise from the nature of the puzzle itself. For example, consider a cell containing a zero. There must be no incident edges, therefore all edges incident to all zeros can be immediately removed from consideration as part of the solution path. Consider a three next to a zero. Because all the edges incident to the zero will be eliminated, the common edge shared with the three is also eliminated. But that leaves only three edges around the three, and therefore those three edges must be part of the solution path. The following table specifies the heuristic rules that must be properly applied to solve a Slink puzzle. The "x" characters between vertices mark edges that are not part of the solution path, while line segments between vertices mark edges that form part of the solution. Grey elements are the pattern the rule is based on, black elements indicate the additional edges that should be included or excluded if the rule is matched. Note that the pictured examples are for demonstration purposes only and do <i>not</i> illustrate every possible arrangement of the stated rule!</p><table border="1" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><th>Examples</th><th>Rule Specification</th><td bgcolor="#cccccc">　</td><th>Examples</th><th>Rule Specification</th></tr><tr><td><img alt="case 1" src="images/3651_r01.png"></td><td>The easiest and most obvious of all the rules.
